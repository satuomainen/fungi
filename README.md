# Fungi in Finland and Sweden

An homage to my late mom's mushroom pages that she had lovingly created for mushroom enthusiasts.
The pages were live from 1998 all the way to 2014 when she passed away.

All the pages were individual static pages but here the idea is to use more modern techs to deliver
a similar user experience. The original site's colors and look and feel are emulated but not preserved
fully.

## Workings

Images and articles are stored in a private repo. Those need to be copied from there to the working
clone of this repo. The assets should be automatically git-ignored.

To serve the backed, run `docker compose up`.
